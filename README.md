# LiMA-Flight-Tracker

As for the majority of industrial giants, Airbus is striving to introduce digitalization
as a core component of the full life-cycle of its products, from design to in-service utilization.

The information that FR24 provides comes from the collection of several data sources including ADS-B, 
MLAT and radar data. The first one is the primary technology it relies on and it works in the following way: 
the aircraft receives its GPS location from a satellite which is then retransmitted via the ADS-B transponder 
on-board together with several other information (e.g. Registration number, Flight Number etc.); 
this signal is then picked up by a receiver connected to FR24 (this service is strongly dependent 
on private ADS-B receivers) and the database is assembled.

The two years of raw data that Airbus has purchased contains mistakes, inconsistencies and gaps, 
therefore requiring processing. Here is where my role lies: creating smart algorithms to process 
data can enable effective visualizations and statistics useful to a very wide range of applications. 
The airlines' usage of Airbus products can be studied and compared to the performance of other manufacturers, 
which can then influence engineering and marketing decisions.
